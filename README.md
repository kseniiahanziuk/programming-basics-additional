# 3b1b1a: Simple Text Generation Task

During this task you will be coding a fun little task
from my field, natural language processing. You will be
implementing a simple traditional model called Markov
chain model for the task of text generation.  

**Task description:**  

- Choose a book that you like (Keep it under 3mb)  
  - Download the book in .txt format  
- Create a python file. In it:  
  - Open the book file  
  - (optional) Clean the text file, e. g. lowercase
  everything etc.  
  - Split the text into a list of its tokens (i. e.
  words and punctuation). You may use native python
  methods or consult other libraries  
  - Create a dictionary object, where:  
    - The keys are the unique tokens  
    - The values are lists of the next following 
    words that occur after the key token (1 next
    word for every occurrence)  
  - Generate text. Make it so that:  
    - The program chooses the first word randomly
    from the keys and prints it (you can use *random*
    library for this)  
    - Then it consults the occurrence list from the
    dictionary you created to randomly choose the
    next word to print out (you can use *random*
    library for this)  
    - Repeat 5.2 200 times  


# 3b1b1c: File editing task

**Task description:**  
You have been provided with a text file containing a list
of student names along with their test scores. Your task
is to read this file, perform some operations on the
data, and write the results to a new file.
create a students.txt file. In it write:
```
Alice 85
Bob 90
Charlie 75
David 80
Emily 92
Frank 88
Grace 70
Henry 85
Ivy 78
Jack 95
```
- File Reading:  
  - Open the provided text file in read mode.  
  - Read the contents of the file and store them in an
  appropriate data structure.  
- Data Processing:  
  - Split each line of the file into student name and
  test score.  
  - Calculate the average score for each student.
- File Writing:  
  - Open a new text file in write mode to store the
  results.  
  - Write the student names along with their average
  scores to the new file.  


# 3b1b1b: Data Analysis Using Pandas Task  

This time we will be working with a .csv dataset.
You are free to consult pandas docs, stackoverflow for
your questions.

**Task description:**  
[Download the csv file here]
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lovishbansal123/sales-
of-a-supermarket)

- Data loading:  
    Load the provided dataset into a *Pandas DataFrame*.
    inspect the first few rows of the DataFrame to
    understand its structure.  
- Data cleaning:  
    Check for any missing values in the dataset and
    handle them appropriately (e.g., by dropping rows
    or filling missing values).
    Convert any relevant columns to appropriate data
    types (e.g., dates, numerical values).  
- Data exploration:  
    Calculate summary statistics for numerical columns
    such as total sales, average sales per month,
    maximum and minimum sales, etc.
    Explore categorical columns such as product
    categories, sales regions, etc., by counting unique
    values and visualizing distributions.  
- Performance analysis:  
    Calculate additional metrics such as profit
    margins, sales growth rates, and sales
    contributions by product category or region.
    Identify top-performing products or regions based
    on sales volume or revenue.  
- Hypothesis testing (optional):  
    Formulate hypotheses about factors that may
    influence sales (e.g., promotional campaigns,
    seasonal effects) and perform statistical tests to
    validate or refute them.
